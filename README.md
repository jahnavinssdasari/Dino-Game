# Dino T-Rex Game Using Java Swing

## Overview
This project is a Java Swing application that replicates the offline Dino T-Rex game found in Google Chrome. The game is developed to provide a desktop experience using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and implements various event handling techniques to control the game mechanics.

## Description 
The offline T-Rex game, also known as the Chrome Dino game, appears in Google Chrome when the browser is not connected to the internet. It features a running dinosaur that the player controls to jump over obstacles, primarily cacti and flying pterodactyls. The objective is to survive as long as possible without hitting an obstacle, with the game speed increasing over time.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface**: Developed using Java Swing to create the game window, render graphics, and manage the game loop.
- **Event Handling**: Implementation of keyboard events to control the dinosaur's actions, such as jumping and ducking.
- **Obstacle Generation**: Random generation of obstacles that the dinosaur must avoid.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of the player's score based on the distance traveled and obstacles avoided.
- **Game Over Detection**: Detect collisions with obstacles to end the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans to run and develop the project.
